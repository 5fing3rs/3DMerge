# Minutes of Meeting

* **Tasks** To find the 4x4(or equivalent) essential matrix and work on stitching(real time later on)
* **Decisions** Work on stiching images first and later work for real-time
* **Information** We explained our progress so far that how we moved from homography matrix to essential matrix to take rotation and translation into account. We also told that we were working on panaroma and real time side by side. The client also saw our code to check the progress
