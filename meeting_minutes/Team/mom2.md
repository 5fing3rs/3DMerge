* **Decisions** Start the work in python3 and port it to c++ later on. Work on the images first and then move on to video. Try making panaroma till !st evaluation
* **Information** Firstly we explained our strategy on how we'll go about the project. We told the client that to start of the work we'll need sample data(.tiff images) which he promised to provide in 3-4 days time based on certain specifications(provided by us). We also discussed crucial parameters such as depth, angles, oclusion etc. which would effect our project. Client was happy to see our progress and planned strategy. We agreed on making a panaromic view from gathered data in next 4-5 weeks.
