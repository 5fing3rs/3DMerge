# Minutes of Meeting

* **Tasks** - Explain our approach to the client to complete tasks for R1.
* **Decisions** - Share documents on git for client to review. We also need to uplaod SRS on git. Use depth images to create a rough model without worrying much about the performance.
* **Information** - First we mentioned the algorithms used(SIFT and RANSAC) and explained their limitation that they cannot cater for change in viewpoint. We planned to implement the stitching algorithm first for 2D and then extend it to 3D(after discussing with the TA's). After this the client explained us the importance of depth data and the need for handling multiple viewpoints. We'll need to bring the images clicked from different angles to same scale before stitching them. He told us to make use of cloud data instead and then create a rough model and then optimise it.
