Camera Setup will be static.
Scenes will not be static and will be at most the size of a table.
Realsense Camera is being used.
Relative positioning of camera will be the same.
We will require a dense point cloud.
After generation of point cloud the texture mapping will come into picture.
Upto 2 m of depth map.
We are getting a RGBD value from the camera.
The camera can take stills as well.
Texture rendering can be looked at later.
### Technologies that can be used
   OpenCV and C++(Final outcome) using realsense2 library.
