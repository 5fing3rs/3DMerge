# SSAD43
## 3D reconstruction project

This project is done as part of SSAD and is being currently developed under 5fingers solution based at CIE.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to 3D reconstruct videos in real time using real time footage from different cameras

## Progress so far
We have formed a list of stiching algorithms which we can use to develop panorama which will be warped around to give a 3d point cloud. Weare using depth images given by the client and finding efficient ways to find a work around that.
